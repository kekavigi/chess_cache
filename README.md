This is my hobby project of combining a chess engine like Stockfish, with a database that stores the results of position analysis, to make it more effective when used. As an example of why I made this: when you use a GUI interface like Nibbler or EnCroissant, have you ever spent a long time analyzing a position, and then accidentally analyzed another position (e.g. due to *mouse-slip*)? Unfortunately, your time is wasted because the analysis you were waiting for is lost, and you have to start all over again. Another example, you've spent time analyzing positions in one program, but there's no easy way to use your analysis in another program, *ugh*. Aside from those two things, I was also curious about creating a database containing the analysis of all standard chess game positions; unrealistic, but what's the harm in trying? I also want to use this project as a place to practice being a good developer. Uh... and expect some *scope-creeps* on this repo.

If you're viewing this on Github/Gitlab, you're actually viewing a *mirror* of the *self-hosted* [Fossil repo](https://fossil-scm.org/)  on my laptop. I'm using Fossil because I find it more suitable for my needs, and because I want to learn SCMs other than Git. I'm not accepting code contributions yet, due to the “*just for fun*” nature of this project, and because there are some things I'd like to try to build/develop; think of this repo as *public source*, not *open source*. You can *fork* this repo, that's for sure.

All (or almost all) comments and documentation in this repo are written in Bahasa Indonesia, because I am Indonesian, and the only one who interacts with this code is me. I use formal/semi-formal language, so it shouldn't be difficult to translate the text I write into English or your language, using a translation engine (like DeepL or Google Translate). Some things are not yet documented, as they are not yet “stable”.

In contrast to traditional opening book building from game results, CDB is built entirely from analyzing individual moves using chess engines while overcoming their problems such as aggressive pruning and blind spots. CDB attempts to explore and define new chess opening theories, currently it includes most of the popular opening lines and yet still refining the results.*
